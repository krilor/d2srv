**Embed d2 graphs anywhere**

## Why?

I got excited when learning about the release of [d2](https://d2lang.com/). While playing around with it, I thought it would be nice to have something similar as [gravizo](https://www.gravizo.com/) so I can embed graphs anywhere and everywhere.

It had been a while since I wrote any go code, so I thought, heck, lets give it a shot.


## How to

```go
go run main.go
```

## Things to think about going forward

* https://golang.org/issue/25192 (semicolon in query) might cause some issues
